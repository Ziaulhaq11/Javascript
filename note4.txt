Everything is an object :

Primitives :
Numbers
strings
booleans
undefined
null 

Everything else : 
Arrays
functions
objects
dates
wrappers for numbers,strings,booleans; all are objects

1.Every oject in js has prototype property which makes Inheritance possible.
2.The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to Inherit
3.The Constructor prototype is not a prototype of itself but its the prototype of all the instances that are created through it
4.When a certain method or property is called, the search starts in object itself. and if it cant found the search moves on objects prototype.
This continues until method is found. This is called protochain.

Function cunstructor and we use prototype to assign the method or property not in the Constructor itself but you have to call them its ideal for methods not for property.

Constructor is like a class 
Constructor & instances

new -- operator creates a empty object

Console : 
john -- gets all the information of this object
Person.prototype  -- 
john.__proto__ === Person.prototype
john.hasOwnProperty('lastName')
console.info(x)

a = 3 ; b = a ; a = 4  //result will be a = 4 ; b = 3;
obj1 ={
    
}
