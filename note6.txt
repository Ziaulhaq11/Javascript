Why we use modules

The answer is that we create modules because we want to keep pieces of code that are related to one another together inside of separate, independent, and organized units. And in each of these modules, we'll have variables and functions that are private, which means that they are only accessible inside of the module. We want it so that no other code can override our data. So our data or code is going to be safe and this is really important.And beside private variables and methods, we're also gonna have public methods, which means that we expose them to the public so that other functions or modules can access and use them. And this is called data encapsulation. So data encapsulation allows us to hide the implementation details of a specific module from the outside scope so that we only expose a public interface which is sometimes called an API. It is extremely important to have all of this in mind when building complex applications. So how do we actually create modules in JavaScript? We use the module pattern, which is incredibly powerful but at the same time incrediblysimple to implement.
